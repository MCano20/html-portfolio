<h3>Scott Pilgram vs. The World</h3>
<p>It has everthing that I like, from video game references, to rock bands, and lots of action!</p>
<h3>Sucker Punch</h3>
<p>I like the storyline, the feeling of escapaing, fighting Samurais, and helping each other out.</p>
<h3>Surfs Up</h3>
<p>I used to watch it all the time with my little nephews. My favorit scenes are with chicken Joe.</p>
